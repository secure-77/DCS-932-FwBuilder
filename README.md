## Unpack the Firmware

```bash
./dlink_fw.py unpack dcs932l_v1.14.04.bin
```

This will create a new folder tmp with all extracted data, don't touch this folder, you need the files for the packing.

You are looking for the folder `root_fs`

Make sure you edit the files as root and donÂ´t put to large files into it, as this archive has a file size limit.

./dlink_fw.py pack dcs932l_v1.14.04.bin.custom
```
